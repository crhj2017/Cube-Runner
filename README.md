# CubeBuild

Here is my first Unity game, which was programmed using C# and Unity’s WebGL builder plug-in. This was my first attempt at an ‘infinite runner’ game to get to grips with C#, Unity, and it’s UI and Physics engines.

Consider this V.1 as I plan to release updates in the future, or a tutorial based around the C#/Unity for this project. Let me know if you want to see more of this!
